Does the offline version sync to the online one?
------------------------------------------------

No, they don't sync yet, but they will in a future version. Here's the plan:

See the next two questions on how to move data between the online and offline versions.

Do I have to pay twice, if I want to use both offline and online?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Paying for the new desktop version gives you a number of months free for the online one.  
The number of months you get is (price you paid / 3.75)

This is a manual process for now, so get in touch with me to receive your free months.

Do you have plans for a mobile/tablet/chromebook version?
---------------------------------------------------------

The online version currently works on all devices. Just visit [https://gingkoapp.com/login](https://gingkoapp.com/login) from your device.

When I release v2 of the online version, it'll work the same way.

A native mobile version would be then next step, but that's still a long ways off.

What are the limitations to the Free Trial?
-------------------------------------------

The free trial is exactly the same as the full version, except that the free trial expires once you've opened Gingko on 30 different days.
