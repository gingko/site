            <h3>Focused by Default</h3>
            <p>Whether it's a novel, a thesis, or a legal brief,<br>the only way to make progress is to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Break your work into <em>small chunks</em>.</li>
              <li>Focus on <em>one at a time</em>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With Gingko Writer this is automatic, because you are <em>always</em> writing in small chunks called "cards".</p>
            <p>This <strong>allows you to tackle larger projects without getting overwhelmed</strong>.</p>

            <p>Jumping around like this is a problem with traditional writing tools. But with Gingko Writer, the big picture, the details, and everything in between, <em>are always in easy reach</em>.</p>

            <p>There's no hard line between "writing" and "organizing" in Gingko Writer.</p>
            <p>And why should there be?</p>
            <p>When organizing, it's important to see <em>what</em> you're organizing.<br>
            And when writing, you need to see <em>where you are, and where you're going</em>.</p>
            <p>This freedom to write and organize at will means <strong>you can untangle your thoughts as you write them</strong>.</p>

            <p>Getting there is the point of Gingko Writer, and it's made easier by the unique way it allows you to work. But that doesn't mean your writing needs to <em>stay</em> inside Gingko Writer.</p>

                  It basically removes the frustration-part, when you stare blankly at your never-ending document and keeps (sometimes even adds) the fun part of writing.
                  I use it for compiling reports on my analysis - and my supervisor always praises me for keeping so clear structure. Well, I praise Gingko for it!</p>

                <p>I love Gingko writer. I use it for various applications, capturing mental models, planning out system architectures and breaking down complex problems to smaller chunks. Having worked on various complex engineering topics in the past 8 years, I have yet to come across something similar that could support me so well as Gingko. My favourite features - apart from the tree-like writing structures, - are the hot keys and the flexible pasting options. Oh, and the markdown support. If you are an engineering manager, solution architect, or just someone who likes to decompose problems in writing, I highly recommend you to try out GINGKO!</p>

                <p>For those who want or need to write long texts, Gingko Writer (yes, Gingko, not the Ginkgo Tree!) is not just another cool-looking editor, but a great solution for thinking, sorting and writing. Gingko helps the budding writer write in Markdown, focus on the paragraph, see the structure of their text, gather and sort ideas and sources—all on one screen. I love this carefully crafted writing software!</p>

                <p>If you're involved in writing of any kind, in my opinion, getting Gingko is be the best move you can make. I'm a part-time young adults detective novels writer and I cannot begin to tell you how this tool has made my life easier over the past few years. I would say that it has easily cut my story development time in half. I've tried many (many) outliners and mind mapping tools before finding Gingko, but nothing compares. This is the rare kind of software that doesn't try to be everything to everybody: it does one thing and it does it extremely well. I also use it often at work to outline anything from reports  to site maps and even Powerpoint presentations. I would give it 11/10 if I could.</p>

                <p>I love Gingko!!! It's super intuitive and allows me to uncrumple my thinking (no small task!) and map out entire projects and courses at macro and micro levels. The owner/developer is also super enthusiastic and attentive re feedback/requests and provides amazing support. Get it, you won't regret it!</p>

                <p>Gingko Writer is a kind of combination outliner and corkboard (not visually but functionally). It’s a little hard to convey how it works because I’m not sure there’s anything else quite like it. Maybe “horizontal outliner” is a better description. You can expand an idea from left to right by adding blocks of text at deeper levels, and those blocks can be easily rearranged by dragging and dropping. It’s the only writing tool I’ve found that works the same way my mind does.</p>

                <p>I am not using this for academic or non-fiction work. It's all fiction with me, baby. The trouble with fiction is the landscape of ideas which move your plot forward change as characters develop. The plot evolves as the story unfolds on the page. Plotting in advance will only get you so far.

                  I was 3/4 of the way through my mystery novel and was stuck big time. I mean BIG TIME. I had a huge character development reveal (building from the previous book in the series) I had the mystery beginning to unwind and needing to be solved.

                  Yes, this all sounds very mundane... a mystery novel. Yawn. Not so. I write these ghastly to plot screwball things. I had to figure out the order of events for: one of the main characters discovering the other already knew their big 'secret.' I had a Karaoke bar, a missing boyfriend, a bank robbery, a murderer, an ex-wife bent on revenge, and the impossible job my crime solving duo had taken for a client: find a missing ham. Yes. Ham. Oh, and the song "Mac the Knife" plays a significant role in it all.

                  I am not kidding about the ham.

                  I had no idea how to unwind all these plot points, what order was best? What sequence could possibly make these ridiculous things fit together an a way that seemed natural? Do I find the ham first or reveal the murderer? Where is the boyfriend? Why did he take the ham anyway?

                  Ginko Writer allowed me to play with options like nothing else I found.  It allowed me to explore where, in this gigantic mess I'd created, was the place with the highest dramatic payoff to reveal each of the plot points. Does the Mac the Kinfe thing go  before or after they realize the ex-wife is setting them up with the bus tour for the elderly --did I mention the bus tour that arrives at the karaoke bar?  Hmm forgot about that.  When should my heroes learn there is a bomb?  Etc. Etc. Etc. Oh I forgot to mention the bomb... See? I need Ginko Writer just to figure out how to write about this stupid mess I'd written myself into!

                  Ginko writer allowed me to lay out possible orders of events and sketch them out for several scenes allowing me judge dramatic and comedic impact of each element. It allowed me to explore  how characters would respond to that particular sequence. The flow of the Ginko Writer system allowed me to find gaps where other pieces could logically fit, and then play it all out to see if everything made its own, crazy kind of sense.

                  Six months of hair pulling.  Three days with Ginko writer. It was magic. Freakin' magic.

                  In case you are thinking "why not Trello?" Trello doesn't have the same idea flow ability. With Ginko Writer I could create several storyboard type "trees" and choose which one worked best. It allowed me to explore many forks in the road and see them all at once. Ginko just made sense, and I'm not even sure I used it right! It is truly amazing.</p>

                <p>Gingko is really a great and unique tool when you want to write or show something.
                  It's ideal for both detailed daily logs/diaries,  or compact whole life timeline. 💯
                  ps. I registered product hunt account today ( Chinese Spring Festive ) just to show my support for Gingko and Adriano Ferrari. 🧡</p>

                <p>Great Application! This works well overall but particularly well when you are unsure of the final structure of the composition as it gives a low-friction way of re-orienting the different portions where it works better as you progress in the writing. To me this makes it a big differentiator from other apps.</p>

                  It just makes sense but in a way I cant quite articulate.

                <p>Gingko Writer has transformed several of my writing and business projects. It is just as applicable to research papers as it is to business plans and mind mapping. Having mastered the keystrokes for Gingko Writer, I find it easy to handle all my outlining needs with one application instead of bouncing around to several.

                  One of the things I like best about Gingko Writer is that it forces me to start with the highest-level outline and then flesh out pieces at progressively deeper levels.

                  Rearranging a whole project is a snap. And whenever I realize that certain levels need to be broken out into multiple parts themselves, the app naturally responds and helps me focus on just those parts without getting overwhelmed by the whole.

                  Bringing an entire file into a Google Doc or other word processor is simple, but I also like that I can backup to / import from a JSON file.

                  It's an exceptionally elegant product, doing one thing *really* well. But the one thing it does applies to a much larger set of needs than you first expect.

                  The more you use it, the more you'll discover uses for it!</p>

                <p>I'm a big fan. Discovered this product in 2018 amid frustration trying to write long-form content.  Novel and screenplay writing apps seemed like expensive overkill, but a simple word processor wasn't enough.  Gingko is the perfect fit when you need more than a document but less than storyboards and character maps.</p>

                <p>I pretty much use the desktop app every day. I've used Adriano's Ginkgo Writer for around 5ish years. I've used Ginkgo for taking notes for my entire graduate education and part of my undergraduate classes. I have also drafted a few safety manuals in Gingko and then used the export function to publish and I believe it is still in use today.

                  One time I used the help function to figure out if there was a way to change the text color and Adriano responded directly to me and I can't tell you how sort of starstruck I was to have the developer answer my inane question. It's that sort of dedication behind the scenes that has continued to enamor me with the product and the developer.

                  I've been a huge advocate for the text editor for years and I have high hopes that it'll get the recognition it deserves and that Adriano will get recognition for his work all these years. I love this product enough that I would wear a t-shirt with the logo on it (hint hint).</p>

                <p>I have used this product for several years, primarily as a tool to assist in building projects that have many repeating sections that each require a little variation.  I build the framework, then go back piece by piece and fill in the details.  I.e., when building classes for the semester, each class needs a syllabus, a schedule, the online LMS update, student keys/tokens generated, etc, etc.  I do one "generic" set of cards that has all the material that does not change class to class, copy that generic deck into a deck for each course, then go through the deck for each course adding in or changing the details that are unique to that course.

                  On a personal level, my wife and I use it to organize our Christmas list each year.  Each member of the family gets a card, gift ideas are added to the cards, and the items are checked off as they are ordered and/or received.  We can access the list from any of our devices and the updates move out to all the devices in a reasonable amount of time

                  Finally, Adriano is very approachable and he has answered several questions over the years that I have used Gingko Writer.</p>

                <p>This product is fantastic. Since I started using it in 2017, I've used it for every one of my longform magazine articles, which often require a lot of historical research (stepping through newspaper archives, tracking down gov't records, etc etc). The mouse-free interface is intuitive and top-notch. It keeps the hands focused on the keyboard and ready to write at all times. Highly recommended.</p>

                <p>I’ve used Gingko since I first heard about it a few years ago. Initially I used it as a way of organizing my curriculum design and courses, but I’ve since used it as a notebook, a repository for notes, links, and ideas, and for structuring stories and proposals. It’s a unique paradigm but it’s incredibly fast, easy to use, and flexible. I’ve even looked into it’s paradigm as a way to organize programming for games. Give it a try!!</p>

                <p>I was one of the original near-founding, if not founding users of Gingko, and I even recall who the amazing creative writer and marketer who introduced me to Gingko Writer first, which was called Gingko App originally, so many years ago.  I love Gingko Writer and there is nothing else out there that does what it does or has such a universal application for all types of writing, and there is nothing more that I would like to see, than for all writers to get behind Gingko Writer and support it now by joining on and giving it a try, and supporting it for the further development that it deserves.  It is great as it is, but I can only imagine how amazing it will become as time goes on with the continued support of new users and the development led by Adriano Ferrari, the inventor and developer of this amazing writing application, and the team he puts together to take it to the next level.  Adriano has always listened to his the desires of his customers and implemented their suggestions that were possible and would advance the usefulness for all customer writers.  Give Gingko Writer your support and join the movement folks, you will look back on this day and remembers it, and be glad you did!  Thanks Adriano!</p>

Gingko allows you to rapidly output what you do know in a non-linear way brain friendly way.  It is an invaluable writing and planning tool... I've been a paying subscriber for 7+ years.</p>

                <p>I've been using Gingko Writer since...sometime in 2016-ish? It's one of the few tools that I still  keep upfront, just about every day. I organize my course lessons, client-work, books I'm chaptering out, scrappy one-time stuff on the fly.....I've even got a tree in there called, "My GrandMaster Plan" - ha!  - It's a joy to use and has managed to stay lean, and bloat-free all this time. Markdown is quick to learn and everything in there just feeeeeeeels good.</p>

                <p>Gingko Writer helps me stay focused while I write. Since I'm working on one card at a time I do much less editing as I type. Thanks to that focus I just finished writing a 60K-word first draft of a novel.</p>
